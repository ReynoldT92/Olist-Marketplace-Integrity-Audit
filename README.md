## 📊 Project Overview

**Problem:** 95% of Olist's first-time customers never make a second purchase, representing a massive retention opportunity.

**Solution:** Built a calibrated machine learning model to predict customer drop-off risk and identify high-value retention opportunities.

**Business Impact:**
- Identifies customers with **81% retention probability** (16x better than baseline)
- Enables targeted interventions with **758% ROI** for high-retention segments
- Provides actionable recommendations based on feature importance analysis

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. **Data Integration** (Notebook 1)
Merged 8 Olist datasets to create customer-centric view:
- Orders, products, payments, reviews, delivery logistics
- Removed data integrity issues (duplicates, canceled orders)
- Defined target: `dropped_off` (no second purchase within dataset timeframe)

### 2. **Feature Engineering** (Notebook 2)
Created 33 features across 6 categories:
- **Delivery Performance:** Delays, early delivery, total delivery time
- **Economic Factors:** Freight %, price per item, installment usage
- **Product Attributes:** Category repeatability, weight, review sentiment
- **Customer Profile:** Geographic location (Southeast vs other states)
- **Temporal Patterns:** Holiday season, weekend purchases, purchase month
- **Behavioral Clustering:** K-Means segmentation (2 clusters)

**Leakage Prevention:** Removed target-leaking features (e.g., category drop-off rates)

### 3. **Predictive Modeling** (Notebook 3)
Trained and compared three baseline models:

| Model | PR AUC | Minority Recall | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Logistic Regression** | **0.9654** | **62.6%** | ✅ Selected |
| Random Forest | 0.9500 | 0.0% | Collapsed to majority class |
| XGBoost | 0.9500 | 0.0% | Collapsed to majority class |

**Why Logistic Regression Won:**
- Only model that identified retained customers
- Interpretable coefficients for business recommendations
- Robust to extreme class imbalance (95/5 split)

**Calibration Fix:**
- Initial model miscalibrated (51% mean prediction vs 95% actual)
- Applied **Platt Scaling** using `CalibratedClassifierCV`
- Achieved perfect calibration (95.0% predicted vs 95.0% actual)

### 4. **Deployment** (Notebook 4)
Built interactive Streamlit web application with:
- Customer profile input form (20 features)
- Real-time drop-off risk prediction
- Personalized retention recommendations
- ROI calculator for intervention cost-effectiveness

## 🔑 Key Insights

### Top Retention Drivers (Reduce Drop-Off):
1. **Holiday Season Purchases** (-0.61) - 61% more likely to return
2. **Repeatable Categories** (-0.44) - Health/beauty, books, pet supplies
3. **Installment Payments** (-0.26) - 26% retention increase
4. **Early Delivery** (-0.18) - Positive delivery experience
5. **Southeast Location** (-0.12) - SP, RJ, MG, ES states

### Top Drop-Off Drivers (Increase Drop-Off):
1. **High Freight Cost** (+0.13) - Shipping >20% of order value
2. **Weekend Purchases** (+0.10) - Lower engagement
3. **Heavy Products** (+0.08) - Harder to repeat purchase
4. **Late Delivery** (+0.15) - Negative first experience
5. **Non-Southeast Customers** (+0.12) - Geographic barriers

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 1. **Target High-Retention Segments**
- Focus acquisition on holiday season shoppers
- Promote repeatable product categories (health/beauty, books, pet supplies)
- Prioritize Southeast Brazil customers

### 2. **Reduce Friction for All Customers**
- Offer free/subsidized shipping (especially >20% of order value)
- Promote installment payment options at checkout
- Improve delivery reliability (reduce late deliveries)

### 3. **Implement Targeted Interventions**
- **Best-case customers** (81% retention): Premium onboarding, loyalty program
- **Average customers** (5% retention): Standard retention offers
- **Worst-case customers** (3% retention): Do NOT intervene (negative ROI)

### 4. **Strategic Insight**
The model excels at identifying **high-retention customers** rather than distinguishing among drop-off customers. This suggests:
- **Opportunity:** Invest in acquiring the RIGHT customers
- **Reality:** Drop-off is nearly universal (95%+) regardless of negative signals
- **Action:** Shift from "save everyone" to "acquire winners"
